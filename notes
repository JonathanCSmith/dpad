Add in idle executors for both client and server
GUI for setup - (blank?!)
GUI for idle - should be the default option guis, i.e. client should be runtime select and server should (perhaps) have debug tools (i.e. enabling packet profiling etc)
Events
Plugin manager
Config

Notes:
- GUI is changed through events
- NetworkManager should never be directly accessed. Instead session should deal with everything internally
- Client side executors will be linear and communicate through sessions
- Server side executors are independent of network communication as all replies should be handled through sessions
- Tasks should heavily trace logging

Global TODO:
- Plugin framework
- Idle Exec tasks
- Idle Execs restore/create standard gui?!
- Idle GUIs
- Disconnect GUI
- Clean up TODOs

GLOBAL INCREMENTAL TODO:
- RuntimeNetworkProtocols
- Reformat local finals to use lowercase + underscores
- Remove listeners when they die

Global MAYBE:
- Have a debug variable for logging in threads to prevent cpu + memory usage (MAY NOT IMPLEMENT)
- White list
- Black list
- Config?!
- allowing servers to blacklist/whitelist ips (not fully implemented).
- Permission ruleset for db access
