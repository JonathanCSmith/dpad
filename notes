Notes:
- GUI is changed through events
- NetworkManager should never be directly accessed. Instead session should deal with everything internally
- Client side executors will be linear and communicate through sessions
- Server side executors are independent of network communication as all replies should be handled through sessions
- Tasks should heavily trace logging
- Plugin Manager thread should have transient database session access so it does not lock down the database
- Network sessions should NEVER hand off database connections!!!
- Plugin handling detailed separately below

GLOBAL CURRENT TODO:
- Plugin version generation from filename
- Plugin manager thread (server side) acquire transcendal database connection
- Idle Exec tasks
- Idle Execs restore/create standard gui?!
- Idle GUIs
- Disconnect GUI
- Clean up TODOs
- Clean up warnings

GLOBAL INCREMENTAL TODO:
- RuntimeNetworkProtocols
- Reformat local finals to use lowercase + underscores
- Remove listeners when they die
- Assess whether event threads need to api accessible

GLOBAL DELAYED TODO:
- Plugin Version checking
- Plugin thread to acquire database access
- Plugin database submission
- Finish plugin database entries, daos and managers
- Plugin guis
- Use of ID generic in recordDAO

Global MAYBE:
- Have a debug variable for logging in threads to prevent cpu + memory usage (MAY NOT IMPLEMENT)
- White list
- Black list
- Config?!
- allowing servers to blacklist/whitelist ips (not fully implemented).
- Permission ruleset for db access
- Can saveAndShutdown + forceShutdown (in engine) be made private. Perhaps also executors?!

Plugin Handling
- Plugins are stored both on the client and the server
- Plugins are distributed globally by the server
- Client can upload plugins
- Version strings are parsed using the filename
- Plugins are added to the database when they are used
- Plugins that are updated need a way of identifying relevant datasets and updating them
- Plugins must include an update feature
- Update feature must be able to handle *generic* datasets from the database
- Server should identify when a plugin has been updated and start applying the update process in the background (threaded?!)
- Plugin does not have a separate version setting. It MUST use the filename to ensure correctness
- Plugin manager on the server must acquire a transient, non-session associated database connection
