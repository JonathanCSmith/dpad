Add in idle executors for both client and server
GUI for setup - (blank?!)
GUI for idle - should be the default option guis, i.e. client should be runtime select and server should (perhaps) have debug tools (i.e. enabling packet profiling etc)
Events
Plugin manager
Minor feature possibility added by allowing servers to blacklist/whitelist ips (not fully implemented).
Permission ruleset for db access
Config

Notes:
- GUI is changed through events
- NetworkManager should never be directly accessed. Instead session should deal with everything internally
- Client side executors will be linear and communicate through sessions
- Server side executors are independent of network communication as all replies should be handled through sessions
- Tasks should heavily trace logging

Global TODO:
- Fix non local login process
- Check for successful login after client network initialisation and fail client if it didnt work
- Disconnect GUI
- RuntimeNetworkProtocols
- Idle Exec tasks
- Idle GUIs
