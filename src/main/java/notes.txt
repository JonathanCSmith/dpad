1) List of things yet to do (volatile :D)
- Add flags for loader stages, initial should be after client has processed
- Build LoaderData DAO + Manager, set in Database Record
- Finished is after server has processed
- Would need a way to load from this...
- Shading of buttons throughout

2) Test plugin (see constant notes 1)

-- TODO:
If current focus is already what we desire, do not change! (Packet spam)
Add validate state to gui tick method
USE SOFTLY CHECKOUT!




******************* CONSTANT NOTES *******************
1)

Testing plugin framework.

On clean build, attempt to set plugin in new data - should return no plugins
On clean build, add plugin to client and attempt to upload
Attempt to set plugin in new data - should return previous plugin from server side
Delete client side plugin and re-perform above step

Verify:
- Plugin is in client
- Plugin is in server
